## Successive Refinement
### Golden Rules
1. Refinements should not be massive - it would more likely end up ruining the original program. Rather. use TDD to make 
smaller/progressive refinements. 
2. Keep Open Close principle in mind while writing classes - assess if this class is open for modification?
3. Keep the exception code separate from the functional code
