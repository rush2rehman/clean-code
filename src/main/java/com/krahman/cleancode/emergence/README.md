### GoldenRules
1. This chapter is about **Kent Beck's four rules of Simple Design**
    - A design is simple if it follows these rules:
        1. Runs all the tests
        2. Contains no duplication 
        3. Expresses the intent of the programmer - naming, small classes and fucntions, pattern usage etc
        4. Minimizes the number of classes and methods
                This rule is primarily about pointless dogmatism - like insisting each and every class should have an
                interface, data and behaviour should always be separated into different classes etc
